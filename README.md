# Windows Tweaks
Windows tweaks made after a clean Windows 10 install

## Create Windows Libraries
Use *WindowsAPICodePack* and matching *...Shell* to create Windows Libraries, include folders, set DefaultSaveFolder location, and set the LibraryType: *Generic, Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos.*

### Things I Got stuck on...

Unsure how to set
1. Icon using IconResourceId property.
1. Public Save Location as property isn't exposed.

*Consider these limitations and set manually using the UI*
